it happened once that when we started the game again after a long while, the 
currency had dropped to -600542. we think it's due to an error in the calculator 
methods calculateOfflineCurrency that gets called upon by the GameEngine.class
right before starting the game in the onCreated method. we tried to recreate the 
bug but it seemed to have vanished. we have no idea what caused this freak
accident
